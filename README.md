# Digital-Signal-Processing-2
This repository contains MATLAB files for Digital Signal Processing (DSP). These files are intended to be used as educational and reference material for anyone learning about DSP or working on DSP projects.

Getting Started
To use these files, you should have MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download a free trial version of MATLAB from the MathWorks website.

Once you have MATLAB installed, simply clone or download this repository to your computer. You can then open the MATLAB files in MATLAB and run them.

Contents
The repository contains the following MATLAB files:

fft_demo.m: A demo of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in MATLAB. The file generates a random signal and shows how to compute its FFT, plot the magnitude and phase spectra, and perform inverse FFT to recover the original signal.

fir_filter_demo.m: A demo of designing and implementing a finite impulse response (FIR) filter in MATLAB. The file shows how to design a low-pass FIR filter using the windowing method and the Parks-McClellan algorithm, and how to apply the filter to a signal.

iir_filter_demo.m: A demo of designing and implementing an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter in MATLAB. The file shows how to design a low-pass IIR filter using the Butterworth and Chebyshev Type I and II filter design methods, and how to apply the filter to a signal.

signal_generation_demo.m: A demo of generating and analyzing various types of signals in MATLAB. The file shows how to generate sinusoidal, pulse, and noise signals, and how to analyze their spectra and statistical properties.
